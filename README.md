# Library Management System WF
With this system, librarians can manage their collections more efficiently and provide better service to patrons. They can easily find items, keep track of who has borrowed them, and much more. Whether you're a small town library or a big university, this system can help you run your library smoothly and effectively.

The system uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and Data Access Object (DAO) pattern for better organization and maintainability.
